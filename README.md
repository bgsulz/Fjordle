#### Rapid-fire Wordle solving action.
- 20 seconds on the clock. Everything but Q on the board.
- +5 seconds for a correct answer.
- No punishment for skipping.

This might sound familiar: you fire up Wordle or Quordle or something, rattle off the same reliable stock guesses, and tack one onto those 5 and 6 bars in your stats. "That must have been, what, 30 seconds? 20?" How fast could you go if those letters didn't flip so slowly?

No more guessing -- we've got everything but Q on the board. Solve, solve, solve!
